                <hr/>
                <p>Predicted profitability of Utah companies who applied to Frazier Group for investment. 
                    First, I led research into their inner workings, evaluating sales pipeline, management, revenue and economic growth trends. 
                    I then ran various regressions, prepared visuals of the data and and presented my findings to the CEO of the company. 
                    I also prepared Quarterly statements for investors in the Lumen fund (Frazier Groupâ€™s sister Fund) on the past and predicted profits. 
                    I was also key in managing relations with other investors in Utah by keeping ties relevant. This meant attending shareholder meetings, 
                    analyzing current financial situations in the market as a whole and determining whether follow-up investment would be prudent.</p>
